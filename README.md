## ✨ What is DukDakit?

DukDakit (뚝딱키트) is an **insanely easy** game server framework for Go that makes building production-ready game servers ridiculously simple and fun.

The name **"DukDak"** (뚝딱) is a Korean onomatopoeia meaning **"in a snap"** or **"quickly"** - exactly how you'll feel when building game servers with this framework!

## 🎯 Philosophy

### Core Values
- **Easy** (쉽게) - Anyone can build game servers
- **Fast** (빠르게) - From idea to production in minutes  
- **Product First** (제품 우선) - Focus on shipping, not infrastructure
- **Fun** (재미있게) - Game development should be joyful

### The DukDak Way
```
복잡한 것은 DukDakit이 처리하고,
당신은 재미있는 게임 만들기에만 집중하세요.

DukDakit handles the complex stuff,
so you can focus on making fun games.
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

Korean has beautiful expressions for **ease** and **speed** that perfectly capture our philosophy:

- **뚝딱** (DukDak) - The sound of something being made quickly and easily
- **술술** (SulSul) - Flowing smoothly without obstacles  
- **척척** (ChukChuk) - Getting things done effortlessly
- **그냥** (GeuNyang) - "Just like that" - ultimate simplicity

We chose **DukDak** because it embodies the joy of creation - that satisfying moment when everything just *clicks* and your game server comes to life!
